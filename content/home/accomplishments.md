The main objective of the project is to help the business understand how much stock to have on hand at a given time and thus avoid cases of out-of-stock – which can push customers to seek solutions from their competitors.

Simultaneously the business can easily check in before the period’s over to see if they are on target to hit the predicted sales and can amp up marketing and advertising accordingly.</p>"""
