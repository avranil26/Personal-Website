  description = """<p style='text-align: justify;'> Centralized Resource Allocation where convex maximization formulation for optimal resource allocation in wireless networks is proposed. Also proposed an alternative approach to solve channel assignment problem using Q-Learning. Used predictive analytics to predict customer churn using classification algorithms such as – Logistic Regression – SMOTE, Decision Tree, Light GBM and XGBoost. Logistic Regression – SMOTE has the highest Kappa value of 0.47 and an accuracy of 0.80 </p>"""
